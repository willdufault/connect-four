# connect-four

My recreation of Connect Four that runs in the Windows terminal. The player has the option to play against another person or a smart bot. The bot checks all seven directions (not up) for streaks, blocks, or wins. It then gives each column a score based on how good of a move it thinks it is, then chooses the one with the highest score or picks one at random if there is a tie.
- The .exe file is under build > Debug > connect_4.exe
